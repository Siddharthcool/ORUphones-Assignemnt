# Assignment

A Flutter project for the OruPhones Internship Assessment.

## 📌 State Management Approach
This project uses **Stacked (ViewModel-based architecture)** for state management.  
Stacked simplifies state management by providing a structured way to separate UI, logic, and services.

## 🏗️ Architecture Followed
The project follows the **Stacked MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture:
- **Model**: Represents the data layer.
- **View**: Handles UI and user interaction.
- **ViewModel**: Manages business logic and communicates between Model & View.

## 🚀 Steps to Set Up and Run the Project
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

- flutter pub get
- flutter run
- flutter build apk --release


### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
bash
git clone https://github.com/Siddharthcool/your-repo-name.git
cd ORUphones-Assignemnt


🔹 Next Steps**
Replace "https://drive.google.com/file/d/14emkK2bCi9k2WsyfFRJT9nwg4RE957nw/view?usp=sharing" with your actual Google Drive link.
Update "ORUphones-Assignemnt" with your actual repository name.

Now, your README accurately reflects **Stacked state management** and the **MVVM architecture** you used. Let me know if you need any changes! 🚀
